'''Edit the functions in this file as you complete the associated tasks.
Each test should utilise aspects of your code to complete the specified task.
These functions will be called by tests in the test suite to ensure you code is working properly.

def task_1a_simple_decay_chain_populations(output_times: list, initial_number_of_moles: float, decay_rate: float):
    '''
    Edit this function as part of Activity 1A
    This function should return the populations of two isomers at a number of output times as one decays into the other
    :param output_times: list array of floats containing the times at which the populations of the isomers should be returned. The first time will always be 0.
    :param initial_number_of_moles: The initial number of moles of Isomer 1 (the decaying isomer). Isomer 2 (the produced isomer) should have an initial population of 0.
    :param decay_rate: The decay rate of the decaying isomer in units of 1/s.
    :returns: Should return two sequences (e.g. lists, Tuples, 1D Numpy arrays) of length n where n is the number of output times. The first sequence contains the populations of Isomer 1 as a function of time, the second contains he populations of Isomer 1 as a function of time. Ine ach sequence, the value with index [0] in each array is the population the isomer at t=0 and the value with index [n] is the number of moles of the isomer at the end of the simulation.

    :param filename: str containing the filename to be read from, with no path prefix (such as "dec-019_K_040.endf")
    :returns: Should be a tuple containing the decay rate as a float units of 1/s, and the change to the atomic number and atomic mass caused by the decay as ints (e.g. (1.0, -2, 4) for alpha decay with a decay rate of 1.0/s)
